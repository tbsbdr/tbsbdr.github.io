<h1 class="font-medium">Hi, I'm Tobias</h1>
<h1 class="font-extrabold pb-7">I create digital products</h2>

I am a product guy with over {{% yearssince 2011 %}} years of experience in developing web and mobile products, working with agile methods.

I have led teams of more than 20 members and specialize in evaluating product-market fit in real-world scenarios. My strength lies in making complex technologies user-friendly.

I have worked on a variety of projects, including optimizing conversions for e-commerce, increasing user engagement in social networks, and finding the right market fit for new or established products. Throughout my career, I have managed several major product launches and developed numerous complex products. My focus is on delivering fast, practical results.
