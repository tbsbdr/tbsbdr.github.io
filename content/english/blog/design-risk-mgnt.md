Risk is an inherent part of any design process. Whether you're launching a new product, updating a service, or implementing a novel feature, understanding and managing potential risks is crucial. Effective risk management not only helps in avoiding pitfalls but also maximizes the potential for success by balancing risks with rewards. The core idea is to identify, assess, mitigate, and continuously monitor risks to maintain control over the design process.

## The Risk Management Framework

The risk management process is a structured approach consisting of six essential steps:

1. **Establish Organizational Objectives**
2. **Identify Hazards**
3. **Assess Hazards**
4. **Develop Risk-Reduction Controls**
5. **Implement Controls**
6. **Evaluate and Monitor Controls**

### 1. Establish Organizational Objectives

Aligning on organizational objectives is the foundation of effective risk management. Clear objectives provide a benchmark against which potential risks can be measured. For example, an e-commerce team might aim to increase revenue per visitor through features like 1-click purchasing. Understanding the strategic goals helps in prioritizing risks and aligning mitigation efforts with business priorities.

### 2. Identify Hazards

Identifying hazards involves recognizing any aspects of the design that could potentially cause harm to the business or its customers. Hazards can range from usability issues leading to customer dissatisfaction to financial risks such as increased operational costs. A comprehensive hazard identification process includes input from various stakeholders to cover all possible angles.

### 3. Assess Hazards

Assessing hazards requires evaluating both their likelihood and impact. This step quantifies risks, helping prioritize them based on their potential effect on the project. The risk assessment can be mathematically represented as:

\[ \text{Risk} = \text{Likelihood} \times \text{Impact} \]

#### Example Hazard Assessment

| Hazard                                   | Likelihood  | Impact     |
|------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Increased number of accidental transactions | Likely      | Moderate   |
| Increased number of fraudulent transactions | Occasional  | Critical   |
| Increased shipping costs and CO2 emissions  | Frequent    | Moderate   |

### 4. Develop Risk-Reduction Controls

Once hazards are assessed, the next step is to develop strategies to reduce these risks. Mitigation strategies should aim to lower either the likelihood or the severity of the risks, or both. This might involve design changes, process adjustments, or introducing new tools and technologies.

#### Example Risk Mitigation Strategies

| Hazard                                   | Mitigation Strategy                                          | New Risk Probability | New Risk Severity |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Accidental transactions                  | Provide confirmation and cancellation options; delay fulfillment by 12 hours | Occasional           | Negligible        |
| Fraudulent transactions                  | Require authentication within 12â€“24 hours of 1-click ordering | Seldom               | Critical          |
| Increased shipping costs and CO2 emissions | Offer "Ship Now" and "Ship with Next Batch" options          | Likely               | Moderate          |

### 5. Implement Controls

Effective implementation of risk-reduction controls is critical. This step involves translating mitigation strategies into actionable changes within the organization. Clear documentation and communication ensure that all team members understand their roles in managing and reducing risks.

### 6. Evaluate and Monitor Controls

Risk management is an ongoing process. Regular evaluation and monitoring of controls ensure that they remain effective over time. As the design evolves, new risks may emerge, necessitating continuous adjustments. Feedback loops and periodic reviews help in maintaining an up-to-date risk management framework.

## Case Study: Implementing a 1-Click Purchase Feature

To illustrate the risk management process, let's consider the example of an e-commerce team implementing a 1-click purchase feature. The primary objective is to increase revenue per visitor by simplifying the purchasing process.

- **Objective**: Increase revenue per visitor
- **Hazards Identified**:
  - Increased accidental transactions
  - Increased fraudulent transactions
  - Increased shipping costs and CO2 emissions

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Likelihood of accidental transactions: Likely
  - Impact of accidental transactions: Moderate
  - Likelihood of fraudulent transactions: Occasional
  - Impact of fraudulent transactions: Critical
  - Likelihood of increased shipping costs: Frequent
  - Impact of increased shipping costs: Moderate

- **Risk-Reduction Controls**:
  - Accidental transactions: Add confirmation and cancellation options, delay fulfillment by 12 hours
  - Fraudulent transactions: Implement authentication for high-value purchases within 12-24 hours
  - Shipping costs: Provide options for immediate or batched shipping to optimize costs and reduce emissions

- **Implementation**:
  - Design the user interface to include confirmation steps and cancellation options
  - Integrate authentication mechanisms for high-value transactions
  - Develop backend systems to manage shipping options effectively

- **Evaluation and Monitoring**:
  - Track accidental transaction rates and adjust confirmation processes as needed
  - Monitor fraud rates and refine authentication protocols
  - Analyze shipping data to ensure cost and emissions targets are met

## Watch out!

Risk management in design is a dynamic and essential aspect of project success. By systematically identifying, assessing, controlling, and monitoring risks, organizations can navigate the complexities of design with greater confidence and effectiveness. The structured approach outlined in "Design Risks: How to Assess, Mitigate, and Manage Them" provides a valuable framework for minimizing negative impacts and enhancing the potential for successful design outcomes.
